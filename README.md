# Class Survey Demographic Statistical Analysis and Report

In this report, we conducted a statistical analysis in R on class survey results for psychological research on demographic correlations. 
This project was completed for the final project of Harvard's course PSY 1900, which is an introduction to statistics for the behavioral sciences.

## Methods
This project includes seven analyses using each of these methods:
- correlation
- simple regression
- multiple regression
- chi-squared test
- t-test vs. u-test
- one-way F-test (ANOVA) vs. Kruskal-Wallis ANOVA + sample size
- Factorial ANOVA

## Experiments Conducted
1. Is there a correlation between the number of hours per week someone studies and the number of hours per week they think the average Harvard student studies?
2. Does the number of U.S. states someone has visited affects the number of countries they have visited?
3. Do the number of hours per week someone works out and/or the number of hours per week someone watches TV have an effect on the number of hours per week that individual spends studying?
4. Does gender affect whether a student likes the Red Sox, the Yankees, or doesn't care?
5. Do iPhone users have more friends than Android users?
6. Does gender correlate with hours spent working out?
7. Do gender and the type of phone influence how many close friends that a person has?
